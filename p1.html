Significant expansions of identification were made,
 including data not only from DSC but also from thermodynamic measurement (TG) and expansion metric (DIL) 
 and thermomechanical analysis (TMA) as well as data about the specified heat capacity,
 cp, within the same base system data.
Moreover, analytical measurement curves usually require accurate explanation that requires a certain level of expertise and a specific time spent:
 measurement comparisons usually need to be compared to the literature or textbook data,
 which are certainly not present for every subject or every case applied measurement - 
 although the amount has increased Information is available in material science that can be searched and constantly found already on the Internet.
 Soon a computer-assisted analysis of thermal analysis measurements was made using the relational database capabilities to extract,
 for example, kinematic parameters, however, these two components by themselves do not make the computer useful.
 Imagine if you turned on a computer, start the word processor, but you can't save a document.
 Imagine if I opened a music player but there was no music to play. 
Moreover, this work is covered in the general limitations of the search routine in the database.
 The applications presented generally relate to the determination of "unknown" measurement curves or only specific parts of the measurement curve,
 the classification of measurements that can be used for quality control,
 finally, the use of the definition as an archiving system for storing and searching for database entries.
