Suppose a university wants to create an information system to track participation in student clubs. 
 From this,the design team learns that the goal of implementing the system is to give better insight into how the university funds clubs.
 Using this information, the design team determines that the following tables need to be created:
 After interviewing several people,the design team learns that the goal of implementing the system is to give better insight into 
 how the university funds clubs. This will be accomplished by tracking how many members each club has and how active the clubs are.
 this will track the club name,the club president, and a short description of the club.Students: student name, e-mail, and year of birth.
 the design team learns that the goal of implementing the system is to give better insight into how the university funds clubs. 
Memberships: this table will correlate students with clubs, allowing us to have any given student join multiple clubs.
 Events: this table will track when the clubs meet and how many students showed up.
Now that the design team has determined which tables to create, they need to define the specific information that each table will hold.
 This requires identifying the fields that will be in each table. For example, Club Name would be one of the fields in the Clubs table.
 First Name and Last Name would be fields in the Students table.
Finally, since this will be a relational database, every table should have a field in common with at least one other table 
 (in other words: they should have a relationship with each other).
 In order to properly create this relationship, a primary key must be selected for each table.
 This key is a unique identifier for each record in the table. For example, in the Students table, 
 it might be possible to use students’ last name as a way to uniquely identify them. 
However, it is more than likely that some students will share a last name (like Rodriguez, Smith, or Lee), so a different field should be selected.
 A student’s e-mail address might be a good choice for a primary key, since e-mail addresses are unique.
 However, a primary key cannot change, so this would mean that if students changed their e-mail address we would have to remove them
 from the database and then re-insert them – not an attractive proposition. 
 Our solution is to create a value for each student that will act as a primary key. We will also do this for each of the student clubs.
 This solution is quite common and is the reason you have so many user IDs!
